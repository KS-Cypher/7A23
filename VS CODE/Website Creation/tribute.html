        <h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
        <p>
            Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity,
            one of the two pillars of modern physics (the other being quantum mechanics). His work is also known
            for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein is best known to the general public for his
            massâ€“energy equivalence formula E=mc^2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation."
        </p>
        <p>
            Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his "services to Theoretical Physics, and especially
            for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect," which played a pivotal role in the development
            of quantum theory.
